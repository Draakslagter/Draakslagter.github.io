                Writing, like game design, thrives on iteration and experimentation. Below you'll find a collection of
                short-form pieces — including 55-word stories and 10-minute writing exercises — created as part of my
                ongoing writing practice.

                These aren't polished final drafts, but rather creative sprints: quick dives into character, tone, and
                storytelling under tight constraints. I use them to stretch my narrative muscles, test ideas, and
                challenge myself to convey emotion, worldbuilding, or plot in a very short amount of time.

                Feel free to read them as snapshots — glimpses into my creative process and passion for storytelling.

                        Oh tragedy, I have been struck down, a sword in my side. I do not have long to live and can
                        already see
                        the light. The teary eyes of my lover approaches. Did I succeed? How else did she escape? I can
                        now die
                        in peace. That is what I guess the mime is saying.

                    <span>
                        On a farm a hog was so hungry he broke out from his pen. He smelled the bread from the farmer’s
                        house and went there. He could not reach the window and all he could do is oink. The farmer’s
                        dog came to help and stole the bread from the window for them to share.

                        Falling down the wall by the swallowing sea is dangerous. Here it is hard to escape it’s ever
                        rising grasp. Timothy fell and could not escape, not matter how hard he tried. To counter the
                        slick rocks, he used his shirt as a glove. This solution saved him from the grasp of the
                        swallowing sea.

                        The black mist rolls in over the gravestones. Me and buddy hide behind the statue of the grim
                        reaper that looks down on us with menacing red eyes. RED EYES? I kick off the statues base and
                        don’t look back, but my guilty subconscious hears the choking sounds behind me. Everything is
                        happening so quickly. I run into the dark woods hoping to find some refuge from the crows that
                        alert them to my presence. I realise my big mistake when I instinctively jump behind a tree at
                        the sight of the furry mess that is a werewolf, gorging on fresh prey. The sickening squelching
                        and tearing along with all the sniffing makes me want to puke. I slowly tiptoe away, trying to
                        avoid all the crunchy leaves and sticks that might alert it. There was no need however as the
                        werewolf, seemingly done with it’s meal, rears back and lets out a frightening howl and leaps
                        into the nearest tree. Frozen for a few seconds I wonder if I will survive this night? I have
                        already met Dracula, so is Frankenstein’s monster next? Shuddering at the thought I decide I
                        should just go home and try and forget about it all.

                    <span>
                        The cold air blows against his skin, the frostbite cutting nearly to the bone. Will he survive
                        against the wrath of nature? He just slew a thousand enemies leaving them in the red snow. The
                        million cuts and bruises on his body wants to tear him apart, but he does not give in. He will
                        reach them – make sure they are safe. They should not have gone far. If they did, they would not
                        survive the cutting blows of winter. If only the warm summer breeze were here, could he drink
                        from the stagnant water beside him. He drops to his knees looking to the skies. “Oh why” he
                        cries.:” My child and wife are only victims.” A flake drops onto his nose melts to the heat of
                        his skin. His eyes go pale like the cloudy sky as the snow grows red around him.

                    <span>
                        “You start by moving your pawns first, right? Almost like when you choose to whittle down an
                        enemy with weaker units in strategy games?” He looks at me confused but continues to listen
                        sternly. “Then by moving a pawn you create space for other pieces to move forward. I think I
                        would move the bishops first since they can move the furthest at this point.” He nods and then
                        continues to listen to me again. I really think I am getting the hang of this, maybe he will put
                        me in charge at some point. I continue with a bit more gusto and confidence, “Then the point if
                        to follow the opponent’s moves and try to take their pieces and if we can get pawns to their
                        side we would have more queens, so we should get them there at all costs, so we can sacrifice
                        the other…” The general puts up a hand. “No Cassidy, you didn’t even listen to everything I had
                        to say and placed your mind in a box. This is war, not a game of chess.” Even though he is not
                        shouting the disappointment in his voice tugs at my heart like an anchor. “Yes, it is true that
                        making your opponent underestimate you and hitting them with a large attack on the flank is a
                        good strategy, but from there you got it all wrong. Pawns can’t just turn into queens; those
                        pawns represent spies we sent to work on the inside. And we never, ever sacrifice our people!”

                    <span>
                        I awake, my head pounding like a hammer on a nail. I push myself up from the dusty floor, my
                        hands slipping on the frictionless floor. After I knock my head do I only realize that I am in a
                        place I don’t recognise. My eyes adjust to the dim lighting in the room, the pitch-black fading
                        to a lighter grey. I get up hearing my bones creaking like an old ship and my muscles paining as
                        if held in a fire. I limp to the decapitated door and investigate the next room lit up in a
                        mellow orange. The window partly shines in this comparably bright light despite being half
                        covered in black tarp and paint trying to swallow the light.
                        I don’t really like seeing tools lying about an abandoned warehouse. Not only does it look like
                        a pig’s pen but gives me the feeling of living in a horror movie. Old, rusted saws, hammers,
                        pliers, and nails laying around as if the craftsman has died in the middle of his work. I blow
                        rockets out of my nose to clear them and then the smell of must hits me like a potent cheese. It
                        is clear to me now that nobody has been here for a very long time.

                    <span>
                        I don’t understand what’s going on and I definitely have no part in this. What do I do? I am
                        merely a writer that was busy writing my story and then it enveloped me.
                        I look around frantically looking for the closest safe spot as large bullets crash around me. I
                        see a crashed helicopter and hide beneath it. Did this really have to happen to me now? I don’t
                        want to get this shirt dirty and I don’t want my notepad to get destroyed. It feels like
                        somebody is watching me and I turn around. I see a half dead enemy soldier clamber out of the
                        helicopter coming straight for me with a knife. I freeze unable to do anything. This is the end
                        of me. A loud bang makes the soldier’s head explode and a look around for the cause. There he is
                        – Antonio - the protagonist of the story. Heroically he rushes to my side and asks “Are you
                        okay?” I just nod, not understanding how he does not see that my clothes are not dirty at all.
                        “Follow me.” he gestures as we make our way through the rubble and ruin of this city. Now that
                        I’m walking through it do I only realize how massive I made it. If I am correct it would take us
                        an hour to get to where he wants to take me. I will never make it there alive. An idea pops into
                        my head. I quickly write down a few notes and I feel extreme nausea as the world shifts.

                    <span>
                        Another day of school. Another day of waking up and having my energising cereal to get me on my way. Glasses – check, schoolwork – check, lunch – check. I kiss my mom goodbye and I get on the bus. Of course I sit in front, I don’t want to be that guy that gets bullied out of the backseat. I’m not that popular of strong to deal with that situation. 
The busride goes by peacefully, I give Chad his homework all is good. Until I see Chad walking toward Alice. Alice is my childhood friend who got disabled from the waist down last year. And now Chad is bullying her for her lunch. 
Nothing makes me more furious. I feel my pupils dilating, my blood boiling into my head, my teeth gritting, almost to a point of breaking. My glasses go flying as I launch forward planting a big knuckle sandwich on that ogre’s nose. 
He stumbles and falls backwards, fear overtaking his visage. He knows what he’s done and what punishment he will receive. Nobody gets bullied but me.
